# Properties-System
It is under Expert System subject. The language used the most are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is just a landing page that can suggest properties for user after inserting some requirements and needs based on user's preferences. The property suggestions are from the logic condition code in the rule.js file.

Please run the index.html file and go through that basic website. On the Home page, insert any requirement needs including the facilities (multiple select), then voila! You will be redirected to another page that has suggested the property based on the requirements you have chosen.
